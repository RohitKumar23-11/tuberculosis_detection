# tuberculosis_detection
This is a ML model which can detect tuberculosis by looking someone's chest X-Ray images. 
The data set link is "https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset".

in this ML model I use Keras Sequential model because it can predict the binary values which is requied for this ML model. In this project I use Dropout, Checkpoints etc. to check 
model's performance and store the best model for testing i train the model to 100 epochs. during labeling I rename the images so I can easily label them.
